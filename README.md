# AtliQ Grands Hotel Chain Data Analysis Project

In the fast-paced world of luxury hotels, AtliQ Grands faced revenue challenges that threatened its market share. As an aspiring Data Analyst, I embarked on a journey to transform the fortunes of this prestigious 5-star hotel chain in India.

## About AtliQ Grands

- **Five-Star Hotel Chain**: AtliQ Grands proudly stands as a five-star hotel chain with a presence in four bustling cities.
- **Network of Properties**: Across these urban hubs, AtliQ Grands boasts a network of seven distinct properties, strategically situated to cater to diverse clientele.
- **Room Categories**: Within these upscale properties, guests are offered a choice of four room categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard, ensuring a tailored experience for every visitor.
- **Booking Platforms**: To enhance guest convenience, AtliQ Grands offers reservations through six prominent booking platforms, optimizing accessibility and ease of booking.

## Project Scope

My mission was clear - to harness the power of data and perform exploratory data analysis that would pave the way for smarter decision-making at AtliQ Grands. To achieve this, we leveraged several datasets using Power BI and Excel:

### Datasets

1. **dim_date**: Contains date-related information, such as dates, week numbers, and day types (weekend and weekday). Utilized to analyze booking trends over time.
2. **dim_hotels**: Provides crucial details about the properties, including property ID, property name, category, and cities. Essential for understanding the hotel chain's properties and their characteristics.
3. **dim_rooms**: Includes information about room IDs and room classes. Used to analyze which types of rooms were more popular or profitable.
4. **fact_aggregated_bookings**: Contains data related to property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity. Serves as a crucial source for calculating key metrics related to bookings and occupancy.

## Data Analysis Using Power BI and Excel
